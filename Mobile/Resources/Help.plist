		Content = "<p>In IRC terms, a bouncer is a piece of software that sits between you and the IRC server that you are connected to. This allows you to do a number of things, including connecting to the same room from multiple locations and stay connected to IRC when Colloquy has been closed.</p>\n<p>Due to the usefulness IRC bouncers, we have built a bouncer into Colloquy for Mac OS X. In addition to being a normal bouncer, the Colloquy bouncer also generates Push Notifications that are sent to your device and syncs connections over from your Mac to the mobile version of Colloquy on your device.</p>\n<p>There are two parts to setting up Colloquy’s bouncer; setting up Colloquy on you Mac and setting up Colloquy on your device:</p>\n<ol><li>On your Mac, the first thing you’ll need to do is install the latest version of Colloquy that has the bouncer built-in. After that, open Colloquy’s preferences and open the Bouncer panel. Fill out the appropriate fields as necessary and write the values down if you need to. Although Colloquy will attempt to forward ports automatically with your router, this sometimes might not work. You can check to make sure the port is forwarded at <u>CanYouSeeMe.org</u>. If the port is not forwarded, you can consult <u>PortForward.com</u> for details on how to forward ports in your router.</li>\n<li>On your device, open Colloquy and go to the Connections tab and tap the “+” button in the top-left corner and select “Colloquy Bouncer” from the menu. Fill out the fields as necessary. The “Address” should have the IP address or host-name of your Mac running Colloquy. You can find this out by visiting <u>colloquy.info/&#8203;ip.php</u> on your Mac. Tap “Connect” in the top-right corner once the fields are filled out, and if all went well, your device will connect to your Mac and download a list of IRC connections.</p>\n<p><em>Note: If you could not connect, it means there is something preventing the connection. Check to make sure your firewall isn’t blocking incoming or outgoing traffic from Colloquy and that the port is open.</em></p>";

Instead of working directly with existing IRC server, you have to run a bouncer that will push notifications to your device. There are three ways to get push notifications:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Using the Colloquy Bouncer, as detailed in the “Colloquy Bouncer” section. This method will only work on Mac OS X Leopard or above.</li>\n\t<li>Using the ZNC bouncer with the Colloquy Push plugin.
