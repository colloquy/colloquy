\f2  IRC URLs are now handled from the system and internally in chat dialog (was only rooms before, now allows new server connections).

Note that only the scheme and host part of the URL need to be present. Valid room paths a begin with '#', '&' or '+'; if the path of the URL is not a valid room then a new message to that user is made. Mozilla's Chatzilla handles IRC URLs in this manner also.\
